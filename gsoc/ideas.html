<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Minutes Checker app performs a simple function: it tells users information about their Virgin Mobile cell phone account. It indicates how many minutes they have for the month and when their bill is due. This app has been installed over 45,000 times, has a 5-star rating (with 1200+ ratings) and I receive feedback from customers on a daily basis.
</p>
<p>
The development team consists of myself and a handful of developers who have submitted patches. This app is ideal for motivated students who have limited Android experience. The code base is small enough that one can easily grasp it and make changes.
</p>

<p>
You'll get experience exploring a new code base with multiple contributors - and hopefully help to normalize our coding styles and practices! You will touch all aspects of the application, from back-end networking code to front-end presentation.
</p>

<h2>Ideas</h2>

<p>
 Most of these ideas have come directly from the aggregate of customer feedback. Others are more experimental in nature.
</p>

<h3>1. User Experience and Design</h3>
<p>
The user experience leaves a lot to be desired. Specific complaints are:

<ol>
<li>The app lets one track multiple accounts; how do I delete an account?</li>
<li>Can we make the widget more intuitive? Can it look better? Convey more useful information?</li>
<li>The app does not adjust to different-sized screens. Users with large screens still get information
rendered in small fonts.</li>
</ol>

The app does have a "help" page, but we should have a UX which uses common affordances and does 
require the user to read a page of instructions. 

<p>Related to this is graphic design. One gentleman has contributed gorgeous mock-ups for 
this app. Let's make them a reality.</p>

<p>As a stark example, here is the current app as compared to a user-proposed design:</p>

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/poundifdef/VirginMobileMinutesChecker/raw/master/screenshots/screen-minutes.png" />
<img src="https://github.com/poundifdef/VirginMobileMinutesChecker/raw/ux_enhancements/mockups/multiple_accounts.png" />
</p>

<p>This project would be great for a student who has experience in UX.
You would be responsible for designing a user flow,
wireframing it, and then writing code to make it a reality. This probject 
would not require as much work on the back-end (eg, networking code.)
Ideas for UX improvements are not limited to what has been described here;
the broad goal is to improve on what we have now.</p>

<p>It would be great to push out changes (yes, to all users) and elicit feedback, and 
iterate a few times before the summer ends.</p>

<p>Mentor: Jessica Graham</p>

<h3>2. Back-end architecture</h3>

<p>As the app has evolved, we have not really spent much time on architecture.
How should we organize the network-related code so that, when Virgin Mobile
changes the information they provide, we can easily fetch those changes? How
should we store user's information, or information for multiple accounts?
</p>

<p>This also entails planning how we should propagate information to the 
front-end. How can we achieve a better separation between the "presentation" and
and the back-end?</p>

<p>Your task would be to take this app's requirements, understand the kinds of changes
that are likely to occur in the future, come up with a design, and then implement.
We should have a standard way to cope with changes, as well as conventions for
code style.</p>

<p>There are no specific ideas for how to do this; we want you to come up with
a proposal and carry it through! Possibly work with one of us as you
write your app to create a more concrete plan of attack.</p>

<p>Mentor: Ken Ganong, Jay Goel</p>

<p> Success here means a more maintainable app, which would make it easier for 
the next project idea:</p>

<h3>3. User-requested features</h3>

<p>There are several new features that users have been requesting sicne the beginning. We
should implement them!</p>

<ol>
<li>Handle multiple types of accounts. Currently this app only displays
information for VM's "Beyond Talk" plan, but some families use PayLo or Broadband2Go plans.
Can we support this? </li>
<li>Users also want to be able to see their call log and txt message usage.</li>
<li>Starting in March, VM will cap data usage at 2.5GB. We should help users with this as well.</li>
<li>Have an option for other kinds of alerts and messages when they are running out of
minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
These are fairly straightforward tasks and would go a long way to make this app 
useful.
</p>

<p>Mentor: Ken Ganong, Jay Goel</p>

<h3>4. Testing</h3>
<p>We do not have a great infrastructure for testing. It would be nice to create mock users
or mock HTML so we don't have to hit the VM website or use our personal information
when we want to test. We should have JUnit tests and then a plan for testing the GUI.
There are bugs that we would have been able to solve sooner with testing.
How can we test for when a user's network connection drops? How can we monitor the CPU
and battery utilization of the background service?</p>

<p>In a similar vein, can we do a better job eliciting user feedback? Ask or survey them,
within the app, about what features they want? Provide news updates to them? This is
not strictly in the scope of "testing" but it is relevant to getting feedback about
things which are broken so that we can improve going forward.</p>

<p>You would be responsible for coming up with different areas and scenarios to test,
and then implementing a framework for doing this. The project would not encompass
all of the above; you would come up with what you think the most effective 
attributes for testing are and implement it.</p>

<p>Mentor: Ken Ganong, Jay Goel</p>

<h3>5. Ads</h3>
<p>Finally, this app uses AdMob for ads. The ads are an experiment - how do users
react? They also help offset some of the costs - the Android account, maintaining 
github, purchasing devices for testing, etc.</p>

<p>There are other companies which serve ads. Can we easily switch ad providers?
What about selling ads directly, rather than going through an agency? We could do
something similar to what StackOverflow does, and do free ad placement for 
open-source apps.</p>

<p>Are there different form factors or ad layouts which make for better advertising?
Can we use other user preferences for show better ads?</p>

<p>Ads are an experiment. It would be fun and informative to play with these attributes
and see what we can learn.</p>
