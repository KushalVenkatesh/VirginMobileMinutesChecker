<b>Describe your organization.</b>
<p>
We are a group of developers who have worked together in the past
and maintain an open-source Android app for pre-paid cell phone 
users to track the 
number of minutes they use per month. The app has over 30,000 users, many 
community patches, and a continuous stream of email feedback and Market
 ratings from users.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Why is your organization applying to participate in GSoC?
What do you hope to gain by participating?</b>
<p>
We were motivated to apply for the opportunity to mentor students, and in that
light we have two specific objecties that we'd like to meet:
</p>

<p>
1. Teach students software engineering skills beyond
classroom instruction. 
</p>

<p>It is atypcial for an engineering curriculum to
have students to look at a codebase with many contributors. It is 
not often that students get to make changes to software and receive real, 
live feedback from users the moment changes go live. How do you deal with
the inevitable "one-star" review? How do you communicate with remote teams?
</p>

<p>These scenarios exemplify skills which are core to the profession of
software development, and are, at best, only simulated in the classroom.
</p>

<p>We want students to build something that thousands of people will use
and feel ownership of their results, rather than a one-off course project.</p>

<p>
2. Improve our own community process and gain experience mentoring others. 
As engineers, one of our responsibilities is to mentor others - be it 
interns, new team members, or trying to explain software to those crazy
biz guys! GSoC gives us a chance to hone those skills. GSoC is part of
our own professional development.
</p>

<p>
Notably absent from our goals are pushing out new features! Of course 
we want to improve our product and cross things off the list that we
have not yet gotten to, but that will be a side-effect of good mentoring
and of students learning about the practical side of software.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>If your organization has not previously participated in Google Summer of Code, have you applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)?</b>

<p>We have neither participated or applied to GSoC in the past</p>
</li>

<li><b>What OSI-approved license do you use?</b>
<p>Our project uses the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause">Simplified BSD License.</a></p>

</li>

<li><b>Mailing list, IRC?</b>
<p>Thus far we have used github for tracking issues, code review, 
and discussion. We may add a mailing list or IRC room if that would
be helpful. <a href="http://www.github.com/poundifdef/VirginMobileMinutesChecker/">Github Project Page</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Personal website, blog, SO, github URLs</li>
<li>Skype or GTalk</li>
<li>Phone Number</li>
<li>School Name, field of study, and level/grade</li>
<li>Java experience</li>
<li>Android experience (what Android projects have you done?
If you have Java experience but not Android, this is okay - we have
many tasks which lend themselves for beginner projects.)</li>
<li>Do you use Virgin Mobile in the US? Do you have an Android phone? (If not, 
this is okay, we can provide phones or accounts.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Describe your project idea in detail. What do you want to do for the summer?</li>
<li>How do you plan to implement this? Include as much technical detail as you can.</li>
<li>What does your project timeline look like? Milestones?</li>
<li>Why did you choose this project? What do you hope to get out of
participating in GSoC, and this project in particular?</li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Backup Administrator?</b>
<p>
Alex Baker (bakester@gmail.com), who is a contributor to this project,
will be the back-up administrator.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Criteria for Mentors</b>
<p>
The mentors are people who I have personally worked with in the past
on sundry projects. They always follow through and keep commitments, 
and have strong technical and communication skills. All mentors are proficient
in Java, and some mentors have a lot of mobile UX design experience.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Disappearing Students?</b>
<p>
This project should be treated with the same urgency as a full-time job;
we have a product that we must support and maintain, so we will
keep track of progress and have communication 
on a daily basis - just as we do in the office.
</p>
<p>If students are not able to meet our original goals, but are communicative, then
that is fine; this is a learning experience and we don't expect things to go perfectly.
</p>
<p>We will talk with students if things are slipping - a telltale sign will be that we 
do not hear from them for a while. 
If a student completely falls off the radar, and we're not able to understand their
situation to be flexible, we will have to ask the student to leave.
</li>

<li><b>Disappearing Mentors?</b>
<p>
As with students, mentors are expected to be available at a schedule that
we have previously agreed upon. We have a pool of several mentors, so if one
is not able to continue then we have others who can step in. Mentors will be working
with each other and keeping track of each other's progress. If a mentor is unable
to perform their duties then someone else will be chosen. 
</p>
</li>

<li><b>What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program?</b>
<p>
We want students to immediately start looking at code, running it on their
own machines, and seeing what kinds of projects they would be interested in. We will
specifically elicit this kind of feedback as they consider working with us
and come up with a project that would be useful and that the student would
be interested in.</p>
<p>We realize that students may not have Virgin Mobile accounts or devices for development;
this is okay, we are happy to provide devices for them for the duration of this project.</p>

<p>During the program we will have regular checkpoints, code reviews, and hopefully
we will push out plenty of updates to get feedback from users.</p>
<p>
After the summer, it would be great if students were still interested in 
this app and its impact; possibly they could be mentors next year!
