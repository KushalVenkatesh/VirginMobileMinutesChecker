The Minutes Checker app performs a simple function: it tells users information about their Virgin Mobile cell phone account. It indicates how many minutes they have for the month and when their bill is due. This app has been installed over 45,000 times, has a 5-star rating (with 1265 ratings) and I receive feedback from customers on a daily basis.

The development team consists of myself and a handful of developers who have submitted patches. This app is ideal for motivated students who have limited Android and project experience. The code base is small enough that one can easily grasp it and make changes.

In that light, here are project ideas which a student could accomplish during the summer, while gaining significant experience exploring a new code base and touching all aspects of the application - both front-end and back-end. Most of these ideas have come directly from the aggregate of customer feedback. Other ideas are more experimental in nature.
